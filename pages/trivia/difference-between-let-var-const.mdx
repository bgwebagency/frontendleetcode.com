## Answer

`let`, `var`, and `const` are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The main difference between them is the scope and reassignment of the variable and how they are hoisted in the code

### Scope and Reassignment

- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned.
- `let` is block-scoped and can be reassigned but not redeclared.
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

Here is an example to demonstrate the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const` showcasing their reassignment and redeclaration properties:

```js filename="example.js" copy
var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;

console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
console.log(c); // 30

a = 40;
b = 50;
// c = 60; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.

console.log(a); // 40
console.log(b); // 50
console.log(c); // 30

var a = 70;
// let b = 80; // Error: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
// const c = 90; // Error: Identifier 'c' has already been declared
```

In the example above, `var` can be reassigned, `let` can be reassigned but not redeclared, and `const` cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

Here is an example to demonstrate the scope of `let`, `var`, and `const`:

```js filename="example.js" copy
function example() {
  if (true) {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
  }

  console.log(a); // 10
  // console.log(b); // Error: b is not defined
  // console.log(c); // Error: c is not defined
}
```

### Hoisting

- `var` is hoisted to the top of the function or global scope.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of the block scope.

```js filename="example.js" copy
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

// console.log(b); // Error: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;

// console.log(c); // Error: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
const c = 30;
```
